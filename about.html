<p>
           Always be learning! It's important for me to break out of my comfort zone, grow and challenge myself. <br>I hold a BA in Media Communications and recently earned certification in coding and web development. <br><br>The creative process in general has always appealed to me. Be it copy, content, code, graphics or some other element, producing something from nothing and breathing life into a story is deeply gratifying. When that story resonates with its audience and the message is on point, it's a great feeling.</p>
           
           
          <p>I am especially drawn to the work of non-profits. The need to overcome great obstacles in order to achieve the desired results is often inherent in their mission. That kind of challenge makes the rewards that much sweeter.</p>

  <p>Speaking of non-profits, here's a blog I write for <a href="https://www.dogsondeployment.org/MilitaryTails/2019/05/ciao-for-now-peanut-2018-dod-mascot-military-pet-of-the-year-moves-on/" style="color:#005aff" target="_blank"><strong>Dogs on Deployment</strong></a> - an outstanding non-profit organization which helps support U.S. military service members by finding boarders for their pets while they're deployed. <br>I'm passionate about their mission, in part because I love dogs!</p>

            <h3>The Road Not Traveled</h3> Some of the events I've encountered and people I have met changed my life's trajectory in unimaginable ways -- good and bad. Among my lessons learned:
            Tomorrow is not a given, 
            think outside the box, less screen time, more appreciating nature, listen intently, show gratitude, order dessert. Above all else, have a dog. Or some other furry, finned, or feathered companion. I've had the pleasure of owning, training, advocating for, and working with animals both great and small. Gods creatures will change your life in all the best ways.
